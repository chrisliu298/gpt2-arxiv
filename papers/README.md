# Modes of Reading Papers (By Professor Jeffrey Flanigan)

This is a great question, thanks for asking! There are a few different ways to read papers, depending on what you're trying to do. Here are some of the ways that I read papers:

## Get the gist of the paper (5 min):

-   Question you are trying to answer: what is the main point of the paper. What did they do that's novel, what should I learn from this paper.
-   Reading method:
    1.  Title, abstract, the part of the introduction where they talk about their contribution
    2.  Depending on how much time you have, you can check the main equations to see what they did, or check the experiments to see how much of a gain they got from their method
-   What to think about while reading:
    -   How does this relate to other things I know?
    -   How could I use this, or where else could these concepts be used?

## Paper review (for conferences):

-   Question you are trying to answer: Is this paper good enough for a conference.
-   Reading method:
    -   Title, abstract, the part of the introduction where they talk about their contribution, and the figures to see what they did
    -   Look over the experiments, and make sure they make sense
    -   Do a quick literature search to see they have correctly reported the state-of-the-art on their datasets
    -   If things look good so far, go back and read the rest of the paper

## Reading many papers trying to learn a field:

-   Your goal: Learn as much as possible as fast as possible
-   Reading method:
    1.  Optional: read or skim the introduction
    2.  Go directly to the related work section, which summarizes many papers at once. As you read it, add papers you'd like to read to a list (I use a spreadsheet). It is often useful to look at the titles of the cited papers as you do this to get an idea of what they are about. Note: sometimes the related work section is embedded in the intro, and the paper has no other related work section. If this is the case, read the intro as if it was the related work section. A variant of this approach is to read the reference section of the paper looking for interesting papers.
    3.  You can skip the rest of the paper. Remember, you can always come back to the paper after reading others
    4.  If you still think you want to read the paper in more depth, then read as described in "**Get the gist of the paper**"
-   To find more papers, use Google Scholar (or similar) to look for papers that cite the papers you are reading, or at the list of papers you've made as you've been reading

## Reading for a reading group (like this class):

-   Your goal: Understand the technical parts of the paper as quickly as possible
-   Reading method:
    1.  Optional: read the abstract and introduction
    2.  Read the part of the intro that introduces their contribution, task or model (usually the last half of the intro). Read it carefully
    3.  Start reading carefully the section that introduces their task/model. Refer to the figures. Pay special attention to their notation, since they will re-use it for the rest of the paper
    4.  Keep reading until you've understood their model, or run out of time
    5.  Spend the last few minutes looking over the experimental tables
    6.  Read the rest of the paper as time allows
-   What to think about while reading:
    -   (See the list in the syllabus)
    -   Are there baselines they didn't try, or experiments that would informative but they didn't run?
    -   How is this different from other tasks/models?
    -   Think about other variations to their approach, and why they chose the one they did.

## In-depth reading (for presenting, or if you want to understand a difficult paper):

-   Your goal: understand everything about the paper
-   Reading method:
    1.  Read the paper carefully in order
    2.  Make a note of things you'd like to follow up on (concepts or papers you're unfamiliar with)
    3.  Learn about the concepts your unfamiliar with as best you can. If there's something you're having trouble with, you can ask us for pointers on Piazza
-   What to think about while reading:
    -   Same as above and the syllabus

Hope this helps! Remember, there's no "right way" to read a paper, and each person is different.
